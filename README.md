# Logit

This is a small little python program that I made to quickly log work in the terminal. 

* up it in your bin local or something. I personaly have my own scripts file cause I am afraid of breaking things then I have another file that I save the log Pickle files in. 
  
## Features todo
 
- [ ] custom output format	(Very stretch goal) (honestly do not think this will ever happen)
- [ ] have the formatting custom part of the info pickle.

- [x] make info pickle have file path location
- [ ] make use of the pickled file path... (I do not know why this was useful...)  

- [ ] custom file location. (I do not think this is a good thing either. What was I smoking?)
- [ ] Make the setup and automatic thing that will be check when the program
  is run for every time... 

- [x] Strip off new lines on import from text file..
- [x] input from file (How do I do the formatting?) 
- [x] import makes weird log name tabbing

- [x] Need to be able to delete entire logs. 
- [ ] deleting should change current... Or let the user choose a current...

## questions I have for myself.

* should I allow each log to be saved in different spots on the computer..? I could do that..
* Is this program worth writing? YES
* Is it worth the amount of time that I am spending on it? You aren't spending
  that much time on it, but stop procrastinating
