# Logit

This is a small little python program that I made to quickly log work in the terminal. 

* up it in your bin local or something. I personaly have my own scripts file cause I am afraid of breaking things then I have another file that I save the log Pickle files in. 
  
## Features todo

- [ ] custom output format	(Very stretch goal)
- [ ] have the formatting custom part of the info pickle.

- [x] make info pickle have file path location
- [ ] custom file location
- [ ] Make the set up and automatic thing that will be check when the program
  is run for every time... 

- [ ] input from file (How do I do the formatting?) 

## questions I have for myself.

* should I allow each log to be saved in different spots on the computer..? I could do that..
* Is this program worth writing? YES
* Is it worth the amount of time that I am spending on it? You aren't spending
  that much time on it, but stop procrastinating
