# Logit

This is a small little python program that I made to quickly log work in the terminal. 

* up it in your bin local or something. I personaly have my own scripts file cause I am afraid of breaking things then I have another file that I save the log Pickle files in. 

## Planned Updates

* Should I make these issues?
* I want to make it so the user can make the logs format stuff
* I want a timeline kind of thing... words
* I want a way of changing the place that the user can save the logs
